      "content": "I have a node js script running on my DS which periodically pings a 3rd party site's API. Based on the response, I want to create a notification and have it sent to my phone (I have DS Finder installed, and successfully received with the Send a test message feature). I've been tearing my hair out for some time now trying to find some way to generate a push notification from this script, but can't even find where to get started. I was hoping there might be an SDK or wrapper on npm, but I don't see any which look like they cover this feature.",

      "writer": "iammephisto",
      "content": "Hello! Just got a new NAS and it was working flawlessly until I actually started to.. well.. use it ðŸ˜‚ I updated to DSM7 to be able to use Synology Drive and Photos which is kind of the point for my needs, and once I really began to sync large quantities of files the nas just slowed down to a halt. Not only was it trying to index 50k new files asynchronously, it seemed like it was also trying to create photo thumbnails and do something with videos. Anyway, basically, all I did is set-up a sync on a pc folder and set up synology photos backup on two phones and bam the nas can't handle it.",

However, from a bit of reading, it appears it could be more complicated than that (need for BSSID, changing MAC addresses, etc). ",
